# angular-hapi-cookie-template

An Angular app that uses Facebook, Google and local logins. The back-end is barebones HapiJS, and authentication is handled via basic cookies, while knexjs is used for the database.

### Configure your app

You will need to create the following configurations files. *.template files have been provided as a guide.

```
    server-hapi/.env -- copy from server-hapi.env.template or set your ENVIRONMENT variables
    client-angular/src/environments/environment.ts -- copy from the provided environment.ts.template file
```

### Setup local HTTPS

To set up HTTPS for local development:
- Generate the keys using LetsEncrypt for your site (You will need access to an actual domain that you can set up the certificate for)
- Redirect your domain to localhost using your hosts file
- Copy the files to the following locations
```
    ./localhost/fullchain.pem
    ./localhost/privkey.pem
```
To make things easy for myself, I use a subdomain and generated a key for that just for local development.

### Running the app

On Windows I use two command terminals, one to run `ng serve`, while API calls are proxied to hapi.
The proxy configuration is in `./client-angular/proxy.conf.json`.

**Note: This setup is for development only. In production, you should use nginx or similar to serve the angular files statically while routing API calls to hapi.**

To run the front-end Angular server:
```
    cd client-angular
    npm run start-dev
```
This will run ng serve with additional parameters to load SSL keys from the ./localhost subdirectory.
There will be a scary message about `--disable-host-check`. If you wish to remove the message, replace the --disable-host-check in package.json with `--host mywebsite.com`.

To run the back-end Hapi server:
```
    cd server-hapi
    npm start
```


I'm using VS2017 as the code editor/debugger; the solution and project files are included. You may step through code by running server-hapi/src/server.js in the IDE.
